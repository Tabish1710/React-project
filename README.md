Our Social Media Post Management System is designed to streamline the content creation process for social media managers, influencers, and individuals looking to maintain an active and engaging online presence. The system simplifies the posting process into a series of straightforward steps, ensuring that every piece of content is crafted with intention and clarity. Here's how it works:

Step 1: User Identification
Purpose: To personalize and secure the content management experience.
Action: Users are prompted to enter their social media user ID at the beginning of the session. This ID is crucial for ensuring that the posts are correctly associated with their respective social media accounts.
Step 2: Post Title Entry
Purpose: To define the essence of the social media post.
Action: Users must provide a concise and captivating title for their post. This title serves as a brief introduction or summary of the content, capturing the attention of the audience and encouraging further engagement.
Step 3: Post Comment Composition
Purpose: To add depth and context to the post.
Action: Here, users elaborate on the title, offering detailed commentary, insights, or narratives. This section is vital for engaging with the audience, providing value, and encouraging interactions.
Step 4: Reaction Count Specification
Purpose: To set expectations and track performance.
Action: Users can enter an anticipated number of reactions or set a goal for engagement. This feature is designed for users to set benchmarks for their content's performance, aiding in the analysis of post effectiveness and audience engagement.
Step 5: Hashtag Incorporation
Purpose: To maximize visibility and reach.
Action: Users are encouraged to input relevant hashtags related to their post. Hashtags are a powerful tool for extending the reach of content, making it discoverable to users interested in specific topics, trends, or communities.

Database Design: You would need a database to store user information, posts, comments, reactions, and hashtags. You might design tables/entities such as Users, Posts, Comments, Reactions, and Hashtags, with appropriate relationships between them.

Backend API: Design an API to handle CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for posts, comments, reactions, etc. This API will be responsible for interacting with the database and serving data to the frontend.

Frontend Interface: Design a user-friendly interface where users can create posts, view posts, react to posts, and add comments. This interface should be intuitive and responsive to provide a seamless user experience.

Authentication and Authorization: Implement authentication mechanisms to verify user identities and authorize access to certain features (e.g., posting, commenting). This ensures that only authenticated users can perform certain actions.
